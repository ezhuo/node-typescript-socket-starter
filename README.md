# Node TypeScript Starter

Since I make a lot of projects, I created this **Node TypeScript Starter** to easily create a new Node project with TypeScript.

## Getting started

- `git clone https://github.com/ezhuo/node-typescript-starter.git`
- `npm install`
- `npm start`

The application will build and run the **Node Typescript Starter**.

## Features

- TSLint
- Strict TSConfig
- EditorConfig
- Different configs for Dev and Prod
- Webpack watch (nodemon)
- BundleAnalyser
- Docker
- Travis CI (Docker build)
